I’m writing this three months after we visited Budapest, and now posting it eight months after that.
Odin and I both agree that Budapest was one of our favourite cities; it's like it took all the best bits of Berlin and condensed them down, creating a more warm and welcoming atmosphere. The coffee was superb, the food was divine, and the bars weren’t all dance clubs.

Unfortunately, I was bedridden for a few days in Budapest,
but Odin managed to walk around and explore the city a bit.
He even took a train journey all the way out to the main train station to purchase our overnight sleeper train tickets to Poland for us!
That was actually the longest we’d been separated for 10 months, so it was a big deal. But back to Budapest.


#### First: Coffee

We’ve been to many European cities. Sometimes you find one good coffee shop, sometimes two (aside from places like Berlin and London). The coffee in Budapest was wonderful. My recommendations include: _[Espresso Embassy]_, _[Tamp and Pull]_, _[Fekete]_, and _[Warm Cup]_. I would say Odin’s favourite was Fekete, given that we actually walked back there from being half-way home just so he could have another flat white.

#### Second: Food

The food in Budapest had a rich assortment of cultures. We went to a little _[Italian]_ place and the pasta was fresher than most pastas we ate in Italy and the sauces change daily. The first night Odin had bacon and broccoli and I was incredibly jealous. They also do cook-at-home pastas, so if you've got a kitchen and no dinner plans it's a good option!
An amazing place, according to Odin the burger lover, was _[Zing]_, in _[Karavan]_ which is on the popular Kazinczy Street.
Being ill most of the time in Budapest, I thoroughly enjoyed _[Bors Gastrobar]_. Odin loved the baguettes and pastas, but I was partial to the sublime soups. But I’ve almost forgotten _[Langos]_! Deep fried bread topped with almost any topping you could desire. Not only that, but the thing was stupidly cheap and bigger than your head.

#### Third: Bars!

We found that the bars were generally pretty chilled out. The few we went to didn’t have loud music that took over, but either separate music areas with live bands, or some mellow beats. We went to a _[ruin bar]_ one night, and actually had to look at the map on the wall to figure out where in the bar we were! There were different sections for different drinks, an awesome band playing in one area, and some really interesting decor.

#### Fourth: Baths

Maybe you’ve heard of the _[baths]_ in Budapest, maybe not. If not, this is more than enough reason to book your flight instantly. It was -5 degrees when we were there. The hot steam rose majestically from the tranquil pools as we lazed in the sauna. A quick dash through the biting cold was rewarded with 30 degree warmth as we sunk into the water. Ok, I’ll stop. But go to Budapest. Go drink incredible coffee, eat amazing food, and spend a full day in luxury at the baths. You wont regret it.
