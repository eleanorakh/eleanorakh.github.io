In 2014 I packed up my life in sunny Brisbane and left for Europe. Armed with
nothing but a desire for adventure, my better half and I spent 14 months
exploring 28 countries.

Now back in Australia and living in the sublime Melbourne, I am an avid foodie,
enjoying experimenting in the kitchen and sampling the never-ending restaurants
Melbourne offers.
